# Multi-Tracker and Forums Registration Availability Tool

### (MTAFRAT)

------------------

## üëã Introduction

**MTAFRAT** is a tool designed to automatically check registration availability across multiple trackers and forums.

It allows you to quickly analyze registration status using a modular, plugin-based system that facilitates the integration of new sites without modifying the program core.

## üëå Features

üì¶ Plugin-Based Architecture

The program works through a plugin system.

Each plugin is composed of three main elements:

-  JSON file
			Contains the plugin's basic metadata:
			name, description, login or registration URL, etc.

- PNG, JPG, BMP, or ICO image file
			This is usually a banner or favicon
			that visually represents the plugin.
			A square image is recommended,
			preferably 48x48 pixels.

- VB file
			Contains the VB.NET source code that implements the 
			plugin's logic and behavior within the program.

üìÅ Plugins Location

All plugins are located in the "plugins" folder.

If you don't find one of them useful and want to remove it from the program, you can delete the folder corresponding to the plugin name, or move it to another directory outside of its original location.
