----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MTAFRAT is a tool designed to automatically check 
registration availability across multiple trackers and forums.

It allows you to quickly analyze registration status using a modular, 
plugin-based system that facilitates the integration of 
new sites without modifying the program core.

_____________

üìã Requirements

	This program requires .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 installed on your computer.

	Download the .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 64-Bit package here:
		‚ñ∫ https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

üì¶ Plugin-Based Architecture

	The program works through a plugin system.

	Each plugin is composed of three main elements:

		‚óè JSON file
			Contains the plugin's basic metadata:
			name, description, login or registration URL, etc.

		‚óè PNG, JPG, BMP, or ICO image file
			This is usually a banner or favicon
			that visually represents the plugin.
			A square image is recommended,
			preferably 48x48 pixels.

		‚óè VB file
			Contains the VB.NET source code that implements the 
			plugin's logic and behavior within the program.

üìÅ Plugins Location

	All plugins are located in the "plugins" folder.
	If you don't find one of them useful and want to remove it from the program,
	you can delete the folder corresponding to the plugin name,
	or move it to another directory outside of its original location.

üí° Tips

	1.  Some websites may keep registration open for several days, or even weeks and months. 
		However ‚Äîaccording to collected information and user feedback‚Äî other sites only allow registration 
		for very short periods, sometimes less than 24 hours, including Spanish sites such as Torrentland.

		For this reason, if you don‚Äôt want to miss the chance to register on time, it is highly recommended 
		to configure automatic execution every hour. This way, MTAFRAT can reliably detect very short 
		registration periods on a website.

	2.  If you enable parallel execution, plugins will run four at a time, meaning that four instances 
		of the chromedriver.exe process (and their respective Chrome.exe child processes) will open 
		simultaneously. This will significantly reduce the total time needed to run all plugins; 
		however, it may also cause unexpected issues in the application. This feature is experimental.

	3.  If you enable automatic plugin execution, it is recommended to select only those plugins 
		that genuinely interest you. Sometimes a website may be down or cause an unexpected error, 
		prolonging the total execution time excessively.

	4.  Every time you run a plugin, MTAFRAT will automatically generate certain files on disk. 
		This is the application cache. If you wish to clear the cache, simply press the "Clear Cache" 
		button in the program options.

	5.  The first time you run a plugin that interacts with a website protected by Cloudflare 
		(e.g., "AvistaZ", "CinemaZ", or "ExoticaZ"), the Cloudflare trial may fail; however, 
		subsequent attempts should not fail. Keep in mind that if you clear the program cache, 
		the next time you run the plugin it will be as if you are running it for the first time.

	6.  If for any reason MTAFRAT logs strange errors related to Chrome while running a plugin, 
		try closing all running processes with the following names: "Chrome.exe" and "ChromeDriver.exe". 
		You can do this easily using the following command in the Windows CMD:
			Taskkill /F /T /IM "Chrome.exe" /IM "ChromeDriver.exe"
		Once the running processes are closed, open MTAFRAT and try running the plugin again.
