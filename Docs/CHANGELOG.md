# MTAFRAT Change Log 📋

## v1.0.4 *(current)* 🆕

#### 🚀 New Features:

 • Added a button in the `Settings` panel to run all selected plugins on demand.
 • Added a button in the `Settings` panel to clear previous log entries on plugin execution.
 • Each plugin tab now has a button to clear its plugin cache.

#### 🌟 Improvements:

 • Improved resource management for Selenium services (`ChromeDriverService` object is now disposed appropriately).
 • Other minor internal resource management improvements with disposable objects and Garbage Collector.
 • Added logic and status messages to differentiate between registration and application forms.
 • Plugins 'HD-Olimpo' and 'HDZero' now also checks for an open application form. (Other plugins may be updated to do the same in future releases.)

#### 🛠️ Fixes:

 • The application used to throw an unhandled exception when no supported language was detected; this is now resolved by automatically falling back to English.
 • Fixed an issue that allowed to show the main window when double-clicking the system tray icon during the initial splash screen.
 • Fixed a minor, internal issue where function `CanFocusNextPluginButtonControl` did not return a value on all code paths.
